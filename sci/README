This project provides the annotator tool used for abstract selection and term extraction in the paper entitled 
"Molecular Architecture of Spinal Chord Injury with Protein Interaction Networks". 
In addition, it also provides a sample dataset of serialized abstracts on spinal cord injury. 
The tool was not tested with compatibility on non-Windows operating systems.

Below are the instructions to use the tool:

1. The bin directory contains jar files inclusive of open access third party libraries provided inside it for convenience. 
The file dependencies are listed under the project object model file bin/pom.xml . 

2. Run the jar file in the typical manner with your latest java runtime environment (jdk-1.8). A jar file compatible with jdk-1.7 is also available. 

3. Select “Load Serialized Abstracts” button and choose the file "Spinal_Cord_Injury_Abstracts_04_02_14.xml.ser" which is available under the data directory.

4. The abstracts will be loaded automatically and the annotated terms will be highlighted in red and yellow colors. 
Terms can be removed or added through the context menu available through the right mouse button click shortcuts.

5. The source code is available under the src directory.
